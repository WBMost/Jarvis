# Jarvis
Old code made to be my own personal assistant similar to the iPhone’s Siri. This project was originally made when I was a beginner in using Git in a slightly more professional manner but for my own passion projects. My Jarvis project was originally created around the time I was switching between my Associate's degree and first professional work experience at Sonobi. This was also created before I was fully enveloped into the world of proper artificial intelligence and machine learning so Jarvis’ responses and functions are rudimentary at best with many hard coded features.
